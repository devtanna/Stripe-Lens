# StripeLens - A Stripe Product Revenue Dashboard

A dashboard for viewing revenue per product from Stripe - something Stripe doesn't provide out of the box.

## Why?

Stripe's built-in analytics don't break down revenue by product in a way that's easy to digest. This dashboard aims to fix that.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Status

Work in progress. I'm building this out as I get time.
